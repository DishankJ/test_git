I have, on observing myself, stumbled upon some things about myself and life among other things. On a side note, the mosquitos have suddenly quieted down. Anyway, getting back on the track. I believe a man can do many wonders, if he just about gets the hang of things he likes to do I think he is then just unstoppable. Getting the hang of things is the easier part if someone is really devoted that also may be partially. I think I'm just afraid of the process. For each step I take I stagger two in the process. That's it. I've had enough and I think I'm gonna really believe in the person I trust most that is myself and do the things I care the most in the moment. 

I, for one thing, am in love with Math and Control at the moment. And I would like to reiterate one thing here that I've found myself repeating sometimes. If you are interested in a thing you need no external force to push you to do it. This was putting it in a way of a physics book. I think one reason I've continued an esoteric subject(which it might not be but I'm an amateur here) such as Controls is because of how interesting the whole idea is. And the one reason I have found myself motivated enough to continue learning Optimal Control is because of how amazing its history and mathematical backing it has for everything that continues in it. Like, there isn't a point that I wonder where the heck did this thing come from or why am I not told what's happening here exactly. I believe that even if devoting myself to Optimal Control doesn't grant me the things that I imagine I will still have something which is immeasurable in the time to come.

Unfortunately, writing is a pain tonight because of the mosquitos and the setting and I don't think I've written clearly what I thought but whatever.
